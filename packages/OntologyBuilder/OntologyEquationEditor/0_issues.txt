  constrain the index handling and introduce two types of outputs,
  one with Einstein indexing
  one with matrix default indexing
  - requires the introduction of transposition
  - and adjusting to the output as defined by the target object

  suggestion - could use sequence in ordered dictionary of the indices

2016/11/28:
  Matlab of Einstein indexing is a problem.
  Alternatives:
    insist of max 2 dimensional objects yields matrix operations only.
    This then implies that one would have to write the code for matlab 
    as matrix operations and not with Einstein indexing.
    This requires an analysis of the dimensions BEFORE the code is written.
    This could be done in the operator classes. 
    Logically one would introduce two alternatives, one with Einstein 
    indexing and one with matrix operations.
  
  Matrix representation:
    - products require to find the appropriate transpositions of the 
      operants and the result
      
  examples:
    index structures : A,B,C,D
    reduce
      c.[A,C] = a.[A,B] |B| b.[B,C]  --> c = a * b   
      c.[A,C] = a.[A,B] |B| b.[C,B]  --> c = a * b'   
      c.[A,C] = a.[B,A] |B| b.[B,C]  --> c = a' * b   
      c.[A,C] = a.[B,A] |B| b.[C,B]  --> c = a' * b'  
      
      c.[A] = a.[B] |B| b.[A,B]  --> c = diag(a) * b' 
      c.[A] = a.[B] |B| b.[B,A]  --> c = diag(a) * b 
      c.[A] = a.[A,B] |B| b.[B]  --> c = a * diag(b) 
      c.[A] = a.[B,A] |B| b.[B]  --> c = a' * diag(b) 
      c.[A] = a.[B] |B| b.[B]    --> c = diag(a) * diag(b) 
      
    


current sequence :
  - define frame and state first and allow for the definition of constants
  - once defined, write them and close program
  - on startup, the additional variables will become visible.

how it probably should behave:
  - once the state is written, it should be frozen and not editable
  - if one insists of editing the state then one needs to propagate the change
    --> much too difficult and dangerous
    --> delete variables except frame, state and constants and start all over
        again by writing the variables and restart (cancel & load)
        AUTOMATIC procedure ???



Changed to:  15 Oct 2015

  - allow for library of ontologies
  - select subject for the ontology -> generates a new directory in the library]
  - initialisation is forced

  - variables as tables
  - constants are numbers


design decisions:
  - ontologies fix the basic structure
  - frame & token symbols and units to be defined at the very beginning
      the must be frozen once used  (TO BE DONE)
  - index set names are the token names
      TO BE DISCUSSED - renaming allowed later - or ailasing table

  - ontology indicates object's shape:
    * for list
    # for number
    . for scalar

    currently one has to edit frame and state, and write
    editing of the other variables is only enabled once the basics have been
      writting -- idea is to block them afterwards

  - frame variables can also have vectors (spatial coordinates)
